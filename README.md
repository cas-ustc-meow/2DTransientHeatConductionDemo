A simple yet useful 2D rectangular plate transient heat conduction simulation using FEM & Implict Finite Difference method.
This simple MATLAB code is adopted from top88.m by Ole Sigmund et al.
Currently only support Dirichlet Temperature boundary condition. If you want to simulate under Neumann or even more complex boundary conditions, just feel free to try adjusting this code.
One more thing--If I have enough time, maybe I can arrange the details about how I implement FEM and Finite Difference methods to simulate transient heat conduction equation and upload relative files to my Github! :)
